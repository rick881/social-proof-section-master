### What I learned

- i learned to use the transform element in css

```css
.ratings:hover {
    transform: translateX(-50px);
}

.card:hover {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
}
```


### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com] - This helped me for transform: translate feature. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
